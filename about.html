 <h1>Our mission</h1>
<p>As undergraduates, we witness a lot of waste on our campus. We realize that colleges everywhere are contributing large masses 
<p>of food waste to landfills, which is very damaging to the environment. We aim to reduce the amount of waste produced by colleges</p>
<p>by providing simple and local opportunities for colleges to make use of both their expired and non-expired ingredients.</p>
<p>By providing a networking system to connect colleges to local composting sites, gardens, and food banks, we hope to significantly</p>
<p>cut down the amount of food that gets delivered to landfills.</p>
